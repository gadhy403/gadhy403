# Bruno Gadhy — Civil Engineer (PMP) transitioning to Software Development



Hi — I’m Bruno. I’m a civil engineer, PMP certified, currently transitioning into software development. This repository is my learning showcase: projects, notes, small tutorials, and practical demonstrations of what I’m building as I grow into a competent, reliable developer.

## About me
- 🎓 Degree: Civil Engineering  
- 🏅 Certification: PMP  
- 💼 Experience: project management, construction coordination, and technical processes  
- 💻 Current goal: become a fullstack developer, applying engineering discipline and experience to build robust software

## Contact
- Email: gadhy852@icloud.com  
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-gadhy/

## What you'll find here
- `projects/` — ongoing projects (front-end / back-end / integrations)
- `notes/` — technical notes and cheatsheets
- `demos/` — quick prototypes and POCs
- `roadmap.md` — my study schedule and goals

## Philosophy
I believe in the power of well-established technical knowledge. I respect what has been tested and proven — classical engineering — yet I move forward with a future-oriented vision: automate, optimize, and scale through software. Learn fast, deliver with quality.

## How to contribute
If you’d like to review code, suggest a project, or share ideas about career/technology, open an issue or email me.
